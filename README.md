Build a new Flask application that accepts a form submission and presents the submitted data on a results page.

The goal is to help you get familiar with sending POST requests through a form and displaying that information. Consider the below example as a guide.

When you build this, please make sure that your program meets the following criteria:

*   http://localhost:5000 - have this display a nice looking HTML form.Â  The form should be submitted to '/process'
*   Save form data into session.
*   http://localhost:5000/result - have this display a html with the information that was submitted by POST

**Don't forget that any inputs we want to be able to access from the form submission need to have a name!**

It's always a good idea to print request.form to see if the form is delivering all the information you need in your routing method.
 Markup : - [ ] An uncompleted task
          - [x] A completed task
* Create a new Flask application
    
* Have the root route ("/") show a page with the form
    
* Have the "/result" route display the information from the form on a new HTML page
    
*   Put the form data into session
    
*   NINJA BONUS: Use a CSS framework to style your form
    
*   NINJA BONUS: Include a set of radio buttons on your form
    
*   SENSEI BONUS: Include a set of checkboxes on your form
